Motivation:
My research work has been focused on the development of new devices and method for cancer diagnostic. This made me particularly aware about the importance of using ad-hoc diagnostics to drive personalized therapy. Several new targeted drugs are being tested as alternative to the more traditional surgery and chemotherapy approaches. These drugs are being examined singularly and in combination in extensive clinical trials worldwide. It is a priority that the trial efforts are coordinated and organized to gain the maximum amount of knowledge in the shortest time possible. Analysis of trial information can greatly improve policy making at every level of the clinical trial organization to achieve these goals.

Data source:
Opentrials.net “aims to locate, match, and share all publicly accessible data and documents, on all trials conducted, on all medicines and other treatments, globally”. They have collected 38GB of trial data from international sources. The data include important information regarding location and institution of the trial as well as number of patient involved. More importantly, each record describes the condition and the tested intervention and give reference to the related publication. Both currently running trials and terminated ones are collected with information about their success or failure.

Data analysis: 
The data is readily accessible through API searches based on targeted queries. For this work, I concentrated on colorectal cancer. This is quite a common disease with about 200,000 yearly cases in U.S. alone. The database returns about 5000 records for “colorectal AND cancer”. The first plot shows a general analysis of the data to establish the yearly distribution of the trials as well as their country of origin. The trials are sorted by their year of establishment. The number of trial is increasing steadily until 2012, though part of this increase could be due to the introduction of new digital reporting requirements that could skew the yearly distribution. The numbers of trial dips sharply in 2015-2017. This is possibly due to thinner and less updated data collected for the most recent trials. Then I analyzed how different country contribute to these data, concentrating on the 6 most active countries. U.S. shows the highest fraction of trials most of the years, though this might be partly skewed by the data availability and the Opentrials organization. The behavior of Japan is extremely interesting and would command a more thorough investigation. Also of interest is the boom of trials in China that correspond well with their increase in scientific production.
A smaller portion of this data was analyzed more carefully in plot 2. I queried for the drug Bevacizumab in combination with colorectal cancer. This drug is the most common used for this kind of cancer. The graph was generated by organizing trials entry as a network structure of trial-condition-intervention and plotted using Gephi. The graph shows a main core of interconnected nodes with few satellites of single trials. The two query terms are (obviously) the biggest nodes in the graph. Though, a satellite group of trials are targeting the metastatic effects of the main cancer. When we look at the intervention, Bevacizumab is close to a group of other targeted drugs, indicating that set of those are possibly combined in the same trial. The combination of targeted drugs, depending on the stage of the disease, is becoming a new paradigm in cancer therapy.
Challenges:
The trial data come from different sources and is clearly affected by non-homogeneous reporting standards. The data need to be filtered for content that has slightly different naming and thus causes duplicates in the node structure. (Deliverable 1)

Ideas and future work:
This preliminary work was extremely useful in clarifying the kind of data available and its quality. I found extremely interesting the chance of analyzing successful trials (and their publication record) together with failed ones. It would be of great interest to model the success (or failure) chances of a trial starting from the other parameters like involved institutions (and countries), number of participants etc. Such a tool could indicate what is the success recipe for a clinical trial as well as a realistic timeline for it. (Deliverable 2) Finally, I found another interesting database of cancer related patent application. This database is more difficult to approach because the information is mostly textual and the keywords are often less clear. But the combination of the two would give a great insight of the direction the cancer diagnostic and treatment market is taking. (Deliverable 3)
