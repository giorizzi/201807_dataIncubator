# 201807_dataIncubator
Code and plots for 2018 data incubator fellowship application

The code is based on https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/opentrials and updated to run on python 3.6

The code scrubs http://opentrials.net/ database to retrieve trial entries for the defined search query.

The queried data is limited by opentrials API to 10000 entries, this is enough for most searches.
