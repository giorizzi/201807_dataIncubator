    briefsummary "Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in France and the 2nd cause of death from\n      cancer. Between 30 to 60% of patients develop limited or predominant liver metastases.\n      Surgical resection of these metastases, only curative treatment is not immediately possible\n      in 10-15% of cases. In unresectable patients, current palliative treatments are based on\n      systemic chemotherapy associated or not with the targeted therapies (anti-EGFR\n      (panitumumab), anti-VEGF (bevacizumab)). In this patient population, special attention was\n      paid to intensified treatment regimens in order to improve their efficiency and improving\n      the tumoral response rate, the intensity of the response and its earliness correlate with\n      improved overall and progression-free survival.\n\n      The intra-arterial use of oxaliplatin coupled with IV chemotherapy has yielded OR levels of\n      64% in patients having survived one or more lines of chemotherapy IV and 62% in patients who\n      have progressed on oxaliplatin IV. In addition, the HIA administration of oxaliplatin limits\n      systemic and especially neurological toxicities, thanks to a greater hepatic clearance.\n\n      In conclusion, the combination of systemic chemotherapy, targeted therapy and HIAC with\n      oxaliplatin has showed promising efficacy results associated with good tolerance from the\n      first line onwards. Indeed, we can expect from the Phase II recent data, a control rate\n      close to 100%, with high response rates associated with early maturity and depth responses\n      as well as prolonged survival. However, to date, in the absence of randomized trial testing\n      this combination, this strategy does not have sufficient evidence to be integrated in our\n      routine practices, and HIAC remains limited to a few expert centers in treatment catch-up."

    publictitle "Safety of Intraperitoneal (IP) OXAliplatin (OXA) in Association With Systemic FOLFIRI Bevacizumab Chemotherapy in Patients With Peritoneal Carcinosis"
    briefsummary "Peritoneal carcinosis (PC) corresponds to a locoregional extension into the peritoneum of\n      rare primary peritoneal cancers, or more frequently distant extension of digestive cancers\n      (colorectal or gastric) or gynecological (ovarian, fallopian tube, or endometrial). PC can\n      be considered as a distinct oncological entity as its genesis, natural history, and response\n      to systematic treatments differ to those of other metastases. The development of PC,\n      observed in 25-35% of colorectal cancers, is generally considered as a unfavorable event in\n      the course of the disease. The prognosis is defined by the possibility of complete\n      resection, possibly after neoadjuvant treatment. The benefit provided by the combination of\n      cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with respect to\n      systemic chemotherapy in patients with PC of colorectal origin has been demonstrated based\n      on overall survival in several randomized trials, among which one evaluated oxaliplatin. The\n      evaluation of the clinical benefit-risk related to the repeated administration of\n      non-hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, as has been validated in ovarian cancer, in\n      patients with PC of colorectal origin is already being investigated by several international\n      teams.\n\n      The FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab every 2 weeks is a modern therapeutic option in patients with\n      this disease. The intraperitoneal rather than intravenous (IV) administration of\n      oxaliplatin, in this combination, could increase the response of peritoneal lesions known to\n      be relatively insensitive to IV chemotherapy."

    briefsummary "-  Few data are available about the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)\n           elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy. Up today, most\n           of the available data are from retrospective/post-hoc analyses, making them difficult\n           to translate to everyday clinical practice.\n\n        -  FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line therapy option for RAS wild-type\n           untreated mCRC patients. Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in\n           routinary practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been\n           prospectively tested.\n\n        -  In elderly patients, a reasonable upfront treatment is a fluoropyrimidine-based\n           monotherapy plus bevacizumab, irrespectively of the molecular status of RAS.\n\n        -  BRAF mutation is a strong negative prognostic factor associated to advanced age, poor\n           performance status (PS), extended and aggressive disease and is associated to a lack of\n           benefit from anti-EGFR moAb.\n\n        -  Clinical definition of elderly (over 70 years old) CRC patients that may deserve a more\n           or less intensive combination therapy is still debated. The cut-off of 75 years old\n           combined with ECOG PS assessment is a reasonable approach for clearly defining\n           candidates to different approaches31.\n\n        -  Several geriatric screening tools have been used to identify patients with a geriatric\n           profile potentially predicting for overall survival and risk of toxicity. The G8\n           screening tool has been validated in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic\n           value for overall survival; the CRASH score is able to stratify patients according an\n           estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities.\n\n      On the basis of these considerations, the investigators designed the present randomized\n      phase II trial of first-line therapy panitumumab in combination with simplified FOLFOX or\n      with 5-fluorouracil, in previously untreated elderly patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type\n      unresectable mCRC."

    briefsummary "b&#34;Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, plays an important role in the disease\n      development and tumor growth in many solid organ malignancies. Bevacizumab was the first\n      anti-angiogenic drug to be approved in solid tumors and has shown advantageous activity with\n      multiple tumor types. However, the responses from Bevacizumab are often transient due to the\n      tumor's manipulative abilities to circumvent the usual pathways to find salvage pathways\n      instead.\n\n      Nintedanib has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer,\n      colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and renal cell cancer. The combination of Bevacizumab and\n      Nintedanib are being proposed to target the tumor's manipulation processes to generate\n      alternate pathways for angiogenesis thus creating a potential benefit to delay tumor growth.&#34;"

    briefsummary "Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) are a sub-group of aggressive\n      neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). The most common primary sites are broncho-pulmonary and\n      digestive. The gastroentero-pancreatic NECs (GEP-NEC) represent 7-21% of all of the NENs.\n\n      Recent data on the initial presentation of GEP-NEC have been reported in two retrospective\n      studies and a French cohort study. No standard second-line treatment has been defined for\n      NECs. Despite a very negative prognosis, these NECs have a certain amount of\n      chemosensitivity, close to that of bronchial NECs. Multiple-drug therapies such as Folfiri,\n      or Folfox, or single drug treatments such as temozolomide are the proposed options but with\n      a low level of proof Bevacizumab associated with a cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown\n      promising results in well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), known for being\n      hypervascular. The efficacy of bevacizumab has also been suggested in patients with NEC, but\n      never in the context of a phase II study. Its combination with Folfiri is efficient and well\n      tolerated in metastatic colorectal cancer. The combination Folfiri-bevacizumab potentially\n      represents an optimized treatment compared to chemotherapy with only Folfiri. No phase II or\n      III studies have reported results for these patients, and no on-going phase II or III trial\n      have been identified to date.\n\n      The main objective of this study is to show that, after the failure of a first-line\n      chemotherapy using platinum-etoposide, the combination Folfiri-bevacizumab allows\n      significant prolongation of overall survival in adult patients with GEP-NEC."

    publictitle "Biweekly Versus Triweekly Raltitrexed With Oxaliplatin (With or Without Bevacizumab) in First-line Metastatic Colorectal Cancer"
    briefsummary "Raltitrexed is a potent thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor. Conversely to 5-fluorouracil\n      (5FU), raltitrexed can be administered safely in patients with cardiovascular disease, as\n      well as in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficit. Since raltitrexed is\n      administered in 15-minutes infusion, complications related to continuous infusion can be\n      avoided, and it becomes a potential good candidate for locoregional treatments as hepatic\n      intra-arterial or intra-peritoneal infusion. Despite these potential benefits over 5FU,\n      clinical trials failed in their temptation to replace the 5FU in colorectal cancer patients,\n      mainly due to raltitrexed toxicity at 3mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Oxaliplatin has demonstrated a\n      synergic effect when combined with TS inhibitors, and its association with raltitrexed was\n      evaluated at 130mg/m2 of oxaliplatin and 3mg/m2 of raltitrexed, every 3 weeks. Actually, one\n      of the first-line standard regimens in metastatic colorectal cancer patients is the biweekly\n      FOLFOX (85mg/m2 of oxaliplatin, and infusional 5FU) plus bevacizumab regimen, since a\n      significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was observed over FOLFOX plus placebo.\n      Biweekly administration of raltitrexed at 2mg/m2 demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile\n      even in patients aged >65 years. Besides, the association of raltitrexed, oxaliplatin and\n      bevacizumab seems safe.\n\n      Then, the investigators decided to perform a randomized pharmacokinetic comparative study\n      between biweekly TOMOX (raltitrexed 2 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 85mg/m2) and triweekly TOMOX\n      (raltitrexed 3 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 130mg/m2) regimens in metastatic colorectal cancer\n      patients, in a &#34;ping-pong&#34; crossover strategy to reduce the intra-individual variability.\n      Bevacizumab was allowed at the dose of 5mg/kg or 7.5mg/kg, in biweekly and triweekly\n      schedules, respectively. The secondary end-points were, objective response rate evaluated by\n      RECIST 1.1 criteria, PFS, overall survival (OS), toxicity, and the comparison of toxicity\n      between two arms for the first 2 cycles."

    briefsummary "A growing amount of reports has consistently evidenced that a sustained inhibition of the\n      angiogenesis is an effective therapeutic strategy, able to improve the outcome of metastatic\n      colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.\n\n      In the last decade different biologic agents targeting angiogenesis have been approved for\n      the treatment of mCRC, such as bevacizumab, aflibercept and regorafenib, and, more recently,\n      solid evidences have demonstrated the efficacy of a sustained antiangiogenic approach even\n      beyond the first progression to a bevacizumab-containing regimen. In particular, two phase\n      III randomized trials proved the effectiveness of prosecuting bevacizumab in second-line\n      switching the chemotherapeutic regimen in patients already treated with bevacizumab in\n      first-line. Preliminary experiences evidenced that circulating levels of\n      angiogenesis-related markers are significantly modulated during first-line chemotherapy plus\n      bevacizumab. In particular, a wide variability of plasma soluble Vascular Endothelial Growth\n      Factor Receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) levels is observed at the time of disease progression and\n      retrospective data suggest that benefit from the continuation of bevacizumab may be\n      restricted to patients with high levels of soluble VEGFR-2 at the first evidence of disease\n      progression. This study aims at prospectively validating those retrospective data."

    briefsummary "There is a paucity of data on the histopathological response of peritoneal tumor deposits\n      from colorectal cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Particularly, no prospective assessment\n      of chemotherapy-associated histopathological response within the peritoneum has been\n      performed so far. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct a clinical trial aimed at\n      prospectively assessing the histopathological response within the peritoneum in patients\n      with peritoneal metastasis from colorectal cancer.\n\n      Recently, Loupakis et al. reported that the triplet regimen of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin\n      and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) in combination with bevacizumab significantly improved median\n      progression-free survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients from 9.7 to 12.1 months\n      as compared with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) + bevacizumab. In view\n      of these data, it is likely that FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab will also lead to a significant\n      improvement of the histopathological response within the peritoneum of patients with\n      peritoneal metastasis from colorectal cancer (pcCRC) as compared with previous standard\n      chemotherapy.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab will induce a pCR or major\n      response in peritoneal tumor deposits in >30% of patients (taking the response rate to\n      FOLFOX- or FOLFIRI-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy from the published literature as a\n      reference)."

    briefsummary "The primary objective of the study is to prospectively assess the histopathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab in peritoneal tumor deposits of 30 patients with pcCRC by determining the % of viable tumor cells (vtc) in the resected specimen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy using standard pathology. In case of multiple specimens, the median % of viable cells will be calculated and used for analysis. The timepoint of the assessment of the primary objective will be during re-exploratory surgery/surgical cytoreduction between days 78 and 106 of the treatment phase of the study. We hypothesize that there will be >30% responders after neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab treatment.  \n Responders will be defined as patients with pCR (0% vtc) and major response (1-49% vtc) after FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab chemotherapy. Non-responders will be defined as patients with minor/no response (\xe2\x89\xa550% vtc) after FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab chemotherapy."

The first-line treatment will be conducted with\n      FOLFIRI plus cetuximab, which resulted in a significantly prolonged overall survival versus\n      bevacizumab in the FIRE-3 study.

    publictitle "Study to Compare CAPTEM vs FOLFIRI as Second Line Treatment in Advanced, Colorectal Cancer Patients"
    briefsummary "Open-label, randomized, multicenter, Phase II trial designed to estimate the efficacy of\n      CAPTEM versus FOLFIRI as second line treatment in MGMT methylated, RAS mutated advanced CRC\n      patients who have progressed on or after first-line oxaliplatin containing chemotherapy for\n      metastatic disease. MGMT will be assessed centrally at Pathology Department of Fondazione\n      IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori prior to enrollment. A minimum of ten 3-micron unstained\n      sections on charged slides of tumor will be required and methylation status will be provided\n      within a maximum of seven days to the Study Centers. Presence of RAS mutation will be\n      assessed at each local participating center. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1\n      ratio to one of two treatment arms:\n\n        -  Arm A (experimental arm): CAPTEM\n\n        -  Arm B (control arm): FOLFIRI Study treatment will be given in cycles repeated every 28\n           days for Arm A and every 14 days for Arm B. Patients in Arm A will receive capecitabine\n           at the oral dose of 1500 mg/mq/die bid from day 1 to day 14 every 28 days plus\n           temozolomide 150 mg/mq/die bid starting on day 9 to 14 every 28 days. Patients in Arm B\n           will receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy starting Day 1 q2w (every cycle) starting on Day 1 of\n           Cycle 1. FOLFIRI consists of irinotecan (starting dose of 180 mg/m2) on day one only;\n           5-FU 7 (starting bolus and 22-hour infusional doses of 400 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2,\n           respectively), and leucovorin (racemic, starting dose of 200 mg/m2 or L-form, starting\n           dose of 100 mg/m2) for two consecutive days. Treatment will continue for up to 6 cycles\n           in Arm A and up to 12 cycles in Arm B or up to disease progression, unacceptable\n           toxicity or informed consent withdrawal. Randomization will be stratified across the\n           treatment arms by the following predefined stratification variables: disease\n           progression within 9 months from the start of first-line oxaliplatin-containing\n           chemotherapy (< vs. \xe2\x89\xa59 months); prior bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatin-based\n           chemotherapy (yes vs. no). Efficacy assessments will be performed every 2 cycles in Arm\n           A and every 4 cycles in Arm B until progression. The study is expected to enrol\n           approximately 82 patients who meet the eligibility criteria."

    briefsummary "BACKGROUND:\n\n      For patients with liver-limited metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), complete resection of\n      liver metastases is the only potentially curative treatment. The current goal of medical\n      treatment for colorectal cancer with initially unresectable liver metastases is to maximize\n      the rate of secondary resection and prolong overall survival (OS). A strong correlation was\n      found between response rate and secondary resection rate of metastases, and the triple drugs\n      combination of infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV), irinotecan, and oxaliplatin\n      (FOLFOXIRI) was recommended can be used in selected patients with potentially resectable\n      metastases in order to improve response rate and make resection more possible. The addition\n      of a anti-VEGFs monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab to chemotherapy has been shown to\n      increase response rate, resection rate and improve OS in the first-line treatment of mCRC\n      patients. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in addition to triplet drugs were\n      previously tested in OLIVIA trial, the resection rate of liver metastases of 49% was\n      reported, and the response rate was 81%; most common grade 3-4 adverse events was\n      neutropenia. On the basis of such promising results, we conducted the present randomized\n      study to explore whether FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab compared with FOLFOXIRI alone as\n      first-line treatment could improve radical resectability in patients with RAS mutation-type,\n      unresectable liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\n      OBJECTIVE:\n\n      The primary objective of the FOBULM study is to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFOXIRI plus\n      bevacizumab compared to FOLFOXIRI alone in patients with initially unresectable\n      liver-limited RAS mutation-type mCRC.\n\n      Secondary objectives are safety and tolerability of the treatment, efficacy in terms of\n      objective response rate (ORR), OS, progression free survival (PFS), quality of life and an\n      assessment of biomarkers for predictive response and prognosis."

    briefsummary "Bev improves the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in unresectable mCRC. In the phase III\n      TRIBE trial upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bev provided a significant advantage in terms of PFS and\n      RR compared to FOLFIRI plus bev. A trend toward better OS was also evidenced. The\n      second-line treatment was at investigator\'s choice. A manageable increase in diarrhea,\n      mucositis and neutropenia was reported, while no differences in febrile neutropenia, serious\n      adverse events and toxic deaths were evidenced.\n\n      A growing amount of data support the clinical relevance of achieving an early and deep tumor\n      shrinkage.\n\n      Phase III TML and BEBYP trials demonstrated that the continuation of bev beyond disease\n      progression combined with a switched chemotherapy regimen provided a significant advantage\n      in terms of OS and PFS.\n\n      Based on recent evidences, the partial interruption of the upfront &#34;induction&#34; chemotherapy\n      before disease progression and the prosecution of bev until disease progression as\n      maintenance treatment is a valid strategy in the treatment of mCRC.\n\n      On the basis of these considerations, a first-line doublet plus bev followed by a\n      second-line switched doublet (from oxaliplatin to irinotecan and viceversa) plus bev should\n      be considered a standard option for mCRC patients. Only retrospectively collected data are\n      currently available about the efficacy of first-line FOLFOXIRI plus bev followed by\n      second-line rechallenge with FOLFOXIRI plus bev. We therefore designed the present phase III\n      randomized trial of first-line FOLFOXIRI plus bev followed by reintroduction of FOLFOXIRI\n      plus bev at progression versus FOLFOX plus bev followed by FOLFIRI plus bev at progression\n      in first- and second-line treatment of unresectable mCRC patients."

    briefsummary "Metastatic diseases were found in 20-25% of patients with initial diagnosis of colorectal\n      cancer and developed in up to 50% of patients. Owing to limited post-treatment response of\n      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combined with leucovorin (LV) obtained in mCRC (metastatic colorectal\n      cancer) patients, other therapeutic agents with different mechanisms were considered, such\n      as irinotecan, a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I, which is involved in the unwinding of\n      DNA during replication. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor\n      angiogenesis by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and was the first\n      antiangiogenic agent approved for the treatment of cancer.\n\n      Infusional fluorouracil/leucovorin plus irinotecan-based regimen (FOLFIRI) with bevacizumab\n      has been widely used as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer\n      (mCRC). Recently, the investigators have shown that prospective analysis of uridine\n      diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) genotyping for irinotecan dose escalation\n      (FOLFIRI regimen) with combination of bevacizumab biweekly as the first-line setting in mCRC\n      patients (ASCO Abstract #491 - 2013 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium).\n\n      In this study, the investigators will enroll approximately 320 mCRC patients (It was\n      considered that an increase of response rate of 15% compared to conventional irinotecan dose\n      of 180 mg/m2, and these were chosen as parameters with which to calculate the study power.\n      Initial power calculation was suggested that a minimum of 140 patients in each group would\n      be required to achieve statistical significance with a power of 80% at the 5% significance\n      level. It is estimated that about 10% of 320 mCRC patients fail to complete the study). For\n      these enrolled patients, the investigators will randomize and divide these patients into two\n      groups: control group and study group. Control group includes mCRC patients who will receive\n      the conventional regimen of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. Otherwise, patients in the study group\n      will have genotyping of UGT1A1 before therapy, and dose escalating of irinotecan will depend\n      on results of genotyping."

After completing the run in phase of the study, with at least 30 patients\n      completing their first line treatment (due to progression, secondary resection or toxicity)\n      and being evaluable for CAF analyses, the results will be reviewed by an Independent Data\n      Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Based on that review the decision to continue with, modify or\n      cancel the randomized part will be made.\n\n      The primary endpoint of the run-in phase with conventional switch of chemotherapy together\n      with the anti-angiogenic agent is:\n\n      \xe2\x80\xa2 Progression free survival (PFS1) of first line treatment\n\n      The primary endpoint of the randomized part with marker-driven switch of antiangiogenic\n      agent and maintenance of chemotherapy is:\n\n      \xe2\x80\xa2 Progression free survival rate at 6 months (PFSR@6) after first cycle after randomization."

Addition of bevacizumab to conventional\n      chemotherapeutic combination regimens has improved the median overall survival of advanced\n      colorectal cancer patients by approximately 5 months. Selecting patients, who will benefit\n      from anti-angiogenic approaches, would be highly desirable in order to optimize treatment\n      strategies. Changes in ocular blood flow may be an attractive biomarker for predicting\n      treatment response. In light of the given alternative first line treatment options such a\n      predictive biomarker would be of clinical benefit. In the proposed study the investigators\n      will assess potential changes in the ocular blood flow of mCRC patients after treatment with\n      standard of care anti-angiogenic/cytotoxic therapy as an early predictive marker of\n      treatment response as assessed by standard CT-scan"

However, the optimal\n      neoadjuvant induction regimen has not been defined, and no consensus exist on criteria for\n      resectability.\n\n      In this study colorectal cancer patients with initially unresectable liver-only metastases,\n      as prospectively confirmed by an expert panel according to predefined criteria, will be\n      tested for RAS and BRAF tumor mutation status. Patients with RAS mutant tumors will be\n      randomised between doublet chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab (schedule 1),\n      and triple chemotherapy (FOLFOXIRI) plus bevacizumab (schedule 2). Patients with RAS\n      wildtype tumors will be randomized between doublet chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) plus\n      either bevacizumab (schedule 1) or panitumumab (schedule 3). Patient imaging will be\n      reviewed for resectability by a central panel, consisting of at least one radiologist and\n      three surgeons every assessment.

    briefsummary "Epistaxis are present in over 90 % of patients with Rendu - Osler . They involve no\n      significant difference 2 sexes. They often appear in childhood and adolescence and are\n      present in three-quarters of patients at the age of 20 years. These epistaxis increasing in\n      frequency and volume to the age of 60 in 2/3 of patients. Epistaxis are spontaneous ,\n      repetitive and recurring . They are highly variable in duration, intensity and frequency of\n      occurrence . Some patients may have more than 40 monthly episodes with mean duration of 5\n      minutes of bleeding and chronic anemia and can sometimes acute anemia with transfusions need\n      to be source. These epistaxis stigmatize patients and inevitably affect their quality of\n      life and social skills . The various proposed ( cauterization , intra- mucosal injections,\n      laser selective h\xc3\xa9mostatses , embolization or surgical dermoplasties ) allow for some\n      short-term remissions . Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic use in the treatment of colorectal\n      cancers . It is also used in ophthalmology intravitreal to reduce vascular proliferation in\n      glaucoma retinopathy and certain corneal neovascularization. In 2009, Prithviraj reported\n      the use of bevacizumab injection to treat pulmonary arteriovenous malformations in a patient\n      with Rendu - Osler . The result is doubly interesting including a saving action on epistaxis\n      which decrease in frequency and duration. This communication prompted the authors to focus\n      more on this medication. The product has been used in local submucosal injection intranasal\n      laser was coupled with satisfactory results objectified by a decrease in the number of\n      epistaxis , reducing blood transfusions and improved social lives. The use of local\n      instillation bevacuzimab represents a way forward for the treatment of these epistaxis."

    publictitle "Efficacy and Safety Study of Bevacizumab Plus Chemotherapy in EGFR-TKI Resistant Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"
    briefsummary "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase is one of most popular target\n      molecules in the field of anticancer drug research. EGFR is highly expressed in many types\n      of tumor cells, which could activate EGFR cytosolic kinase activity by binding to its ligand\n      EGF, and regulates gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis through\n      different signal transduction pathways. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase\n      inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), competitive to specifically combined with the EGFR kinase domain, thus\n      inhibits its kinase activity, thereby blocking cancer cell proliferation or metastasis. At\n      present, EGFR-TKI has been widely used in clinical activity, especially in patients with\n      EGFR mutations, which had been proved to achieved a certain effect. But with the passage of\n      time, a drug resistance is inevitable.\n\n      At present, studies have found that the cessation of treatment immediately after EGFR-TKI\n      resistance may lead to rapid progress of cancer. Chemotherapy, as one of the most widely\n      accepted modality in cancer treatment, might also be one of the salvage therapies of target\n      treatment. Therefore, in patients with better physical status (PS) scores, chemotherapy is\n      commonly applicable.\n\n      In January 2010, a study published in the journal of Clinical Lung Cancer reported the\n      application of chemotherapy as salvage treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer\n      (NSCLC) patients with resistant to first-line EGFR-TKI treatment. Of the 114 patients\n      enrolled, 67 received sequential chemotherapy, the other 47 patients received best\n      supportive care. The results showed that, sequential chemotherapy can improve the survival\n      time of the patients, compared with chemotherapy and supportive care groups (11.2 months vs.\n      3.8 months, P< 0.01). Furthermore, in those who received sequential chemotherapy, a regimen\n      containing paclitaxel got higher efficiency and disease control rate than those without\n      (48.7% vs. 21.4%, 79.5% vs. 53.5% , P< 0.05), as well as longer progression-free survival\n      (PFS, 5.1 months vs. 1.8 months, P< 0.01) and overall survival (OS, 12.7 months vs. 7\n      months, P< 0.01).\n\n      Another study in Taiwan which enrolled 195 patients treated with at least 1 cycles\n      sequential chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib shown similar results. Generally,\n      gefitinib as a first-line treatment had PFS for 5 months, and the second-line treatment\n      efficiency was 14.4%. Regimens of platinum or paclitaxel had a better treatment efficiency\n      (50.6%). A poor therapeutic effect was reported for gefitinib as second-line therapy (5.6%).\n      In total, the median OS of second-line treatment was 12.2 months. In addition, platinum\n      containing regimens survival better (21.7 months vs. 8.9 months, P< 0.01); patients with\n      mutant EGFR benefit more in a platinum-based chemotherapy (24.5 months vs. 8.5 months, P<\n      0.05).\n\n      Bevacizumab (trade name Avastin \xc2\xae) is a kind of recombinant humanized monoclonal\n      immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) antibody, which can selectively inhibit the combination\n      process of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, Flt-1 and kinase\n      domain receptor (KDR) in endothelial cells. A reduction of tumor angiogenesis, blood supply,\n      oxygen and other nutrients supply could be obtained after the VEGF loss of its biological\n      activity, thus inhibit tumor growth. The drug was approved for the first-line treatment of\n      advanced colorectal cancer in 2004 by America food and Drug Administration (FDA),thus became\n      the first for clinical use of drugs that targeting VEGF. As the first globally approved\n      anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody drugs, bevacizumab has approved for advanced colorectal\n      cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and malignant glioma patients,\n      which was used in more than 500000 cases. In the field of advanced NSCLC treatment, clinical\n      results confirm bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy can prolong OS and PFS of patients\n      with NSCLC, and well tolerated.\n\n      The thirty-fifth annual meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO)\n      conference released a meta analysis results of bevacizumab combined with platinum\n      chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced non squamous NSCLC. It is confirmed that,\n      treatment with bevacizumab based chemotherapy for advanced non squamous NSCLC patients could\n      achieve significant survival benefit, prolong remission time, and expected safety.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators design this phase II to testify the efficacy and safety of\n      bevacizumab + chemotherapy for EGFR-TKI resistant non squamous NSCLC."

    briefsummary "This study involves standard combination chemotherapy treatment for colon cancer,\n      5-Fluorouracil (5FU), leucovorin and irinotecan (known as FOLFIRI), plus bevacizumab\n      (Avastin). The study is designed to test the FOLFIRI regimen based on certain\n      characteristics of a person\'s genetic makeup or &#34;genes&#34;. Genes are made of DNA and determine\n      not only inherited traits or appearance (hair and eye color, height, body type, etc.) but\n      also play an important role in health and how the body responds to illness and treatments\n      for those illnesses.\n\n      In this study, the investigators will examine the relationship between a patient\'s genes\n      (DNA), or &#34;genotype&#34;, and how the patient\'s body breaks down and removes or &#34;metabolizes&#34;\n      the anti-cancer drug irinotecan. Circulating blood level of irinotecan plays an important\n      role in how well this drug works against a patient\'s cancer as well as the adverse side\n      effects the patient may experience. The current standard dose of irinotecan was determined\n      in clinical trials without knowing individual genotypes and thus does not take into account\n      a patient\'s ability to metabolize irinotecan. This means that based on one genotype the\n      current standard dose of irinotecan may be correct or based on other genotypes the standard\n      dose could result in lower and possibly less effective blood levels and result in\n      significant under-dosing of irinotecan.\n\n      Based on genotype the patient will be assigned to one of the following doses of irinotecan:\n\n        -  180 mg/m2 (standard dose)\n\n        -  260 mg/m2\n\n        -  310 mg/m2\n\n      The purpose of this research study is to determine if dosing irinotecan based on genotype is\n      effective and safe for patients with colon cancer. Patient genotype will be determined from\n      a small sample of blood and a laboratory test or &#34;assay&#34; performed at UNC Laboratories. For\n      the purpose of this study, this assay is new and considered to be &#34;investigational&#34;. This\n      means that the genotype assay used in this study has not yet been approved by the FDA for\n      determining irinotecan dose levels in patients with colon cancer."

    briefsummary "b&#34;Since its introduction, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been the cornerstone of treatment for\n      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Meanwhile the oral 5FU pro-drug Capecitabine (Xeloda\xc2\xae)\n      proved equivalence to 5-FU and is a well tolerated alternative combination partner for\n      Irinotecan (XELIRI) or Oxaliplatin (XELOX) which are widely used for first line treatment of\n      mCRC. Recent advances in molecular biology have resulted in the development of an inhibitor\n      of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the monoclonal humanized antibody\n      bevacizumab (Avastin\xc2\xae).\n\n      XELOX or XELIRI +bevacizumab have been investigated in several trials, but not in an\n      approach with clearly defined cross-wise XELIRI-XELOX change criteria. This trial\n      investigates two different sequential treatment options with XELIRI/ XELOX in first and\n      second line with the addition of bevacizumab and tries to give answer to the question if\n      there is an optimal sequence for the benefit of the patient.\n\n      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, 2-arm pilot trial in patients with mCRC who\n      did not receive systemic treatment for their metastatic disease. The study is designed to\n      evaluate the efficacy of XELIRI followed by XELOX and XELOX followed by XELIRI + bevacizumab\n      in terms of Duration of Disease Control (DDC).\n\n      Patients will be treated with an established first line therapy consisting of either XELOX\n      or XELIRI + bevacizumab. The chemotherapy treatment will be given for 6 months except prior\n      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. Bevacizumab will be given\n      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.\n\n      Capecitabine can be given in addition at the investigators' discretion until disease\n      progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.\n\n      If serious side effects occur despite adequate dose reduction, Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan\n      should be discontinued. In case of Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan-related discontinuation\n      Capecitabine and Bevacizumab should be continued. If Capecitabine also has to be\n      discontinued in first line treatment bevacizumab should be continued. In case of permanent\n      discontinuation of bevacizumab for toxicities, chemotherapy should be continued.\n\n      Upon completion of first line chemotherapy patients with disease control will receive\n      bevacizumab maintenance treatment. On investigators decision patients can receive\n      Capecitabine as additional maintenance treatment.\n\n      The primary endpoint is to determine the efficacy of a modified XELIRI + bevacizumab\n      followed by XELOX + bevacizumab scheme at progression in comparison with the reverse\n      sequence based on DDC.\n\n      Secondary endpoints are first line progression-free survival (PFS), second line PFS, overall\n      response rate, time to response, duration of response, overall survival, tumor assessments\n      (based on RECIST criteria) using CT scans, MRI scans, X-ray, bone scan, clinical\n      examination.&#34;"

    publictitle "Study Evaluating the Influence of LV5FU2 Bevacizumab Plus Anakinra Association on Metastatic Colorectal Cancer"
    briefsummary "The metastatic colon cancer is a major public health problem despite advances in\n      chemotherapy; few new drugs are in development for the treatment of this pathology.\n\n      Many studies have shown that human colon cancer is a tumor that is recognized by the immune\n      system and the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates in the tumor bed is associated with a\n      better prognosis. Conversely, the effect of chemotherapy on the immune response is little\n      studied.\n\n      Recently the importance of myeloid suppressor cells (MDSC) in the development of colon\n      cancer and the effect of 5- fluorouracil on this cell population has been highlighted. An\n      accumulation of these cells in the blood and lymphoid organs during tumor progression is\n      observed. Moreover, it has been established that the death of MDSC induced by 5-fluorouracil\n      induces activation of caspase -1 and IL-1beta by these MDSC.\n\n      These events promote the polarization of CD4 T cells in intratumoral Th17 lymphocytes. The\n      IL- 17 produced by these cells exerts a pro-angiogenic effect in inducing proliferation of\n      endothelial cells expressing and thus limits the effect of 5- fluorouracil endoglin.\n\n      In humans, it has also been observed that chemotherapy using 5- fluorouracil and in\n      particular LV5FU2 association +/- bevacizumab induces rapid death of blood MDSC as well as\n      activation of caspase 1 in these cells. Thus, production of IL - 1 is detected in the serum\n      of patients after 24 hours of the administration of 5-fluorouracil.\n\n      Chronic inflammation and the production of interleukin- 1 can alter the effectiveness of\n      anti -tumor immune responses and facilitate angiogenesis. Many preclinical data suggest a\n      role of anti -tumor inhibition of IL- 1beta, but the effect of a combination of chemotherapy\n      and an inhibitor of IL - 1beta has not yet been tested in human.\n\n      Anakinra is a drug used in humans for many years to treat signs and symptoms of rheumatoid\n      arthritis. In combination with methotrexate, in patients whose response to methotrexate\n      alone is not satisfactory it had shown interesting results. The dose used clinically is 100\n      mg per day which is the dose that is proposed to be tested in this study.\n\n      In this context it should be remembered that methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent from\n      the class of antimetabolites such as 5- fluorouracil.\n\n      RCP of this drug indicate that in studies originator toxicity was similar between the\n      control arm and anakinra arm with an increase in serious infections (1.8 % vs 0.7 %) and an\n      increased incidence of neutropenia (2.5 % neutropenia > grade = 1). The main toxicity\n      observed is a painful inflammatory reaction at the injection site in 70 % of patients The\n      investigators believe that this project could permit to validate in man preclinical\n      observations showing an anti-tumor potential for combination anakinra and 5 fluorouracil."

Study Objectives 1) Primary Objective: Progression-free survival 2) Secondary\n           Objectives:\n\n             1. overall survival\n\n             2. response rate\n\n             3. incidence, nature and severity of all adverse events\n\n             4. lipid lowering effect of simvastatin\n\n             5. exploratory biomarker analysis : angiopoietin 2, BiP (Binding protein), Hsp (Heat\n                shck protein) 90\xce\xb1\n\n        2. Study hypothesis In our recent in vitro study, addition of simvastatin to bevacizumab\n           reduced proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation of endothelial cell.\n           Moreover, colorectal cancer cell media which was treated with simvastatin combined with\n           bevacizumab inhibited endothelial cell invasion and it was associated with decreased\n           mediator of angiogenesis, such as angiopoietin 2, BiP and HSP 90\xce\xb1.. Treatment with\n           bevacizumab and simvastatin more reduced the growth of xenograft tumors compared with\n           bevacizumab alone.\n\n        3. Assessments 1) Safety : physical examination, vital signs, body weight, ECOG (Eastern\n           Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status, clinical laboratory evaluation\n           (chemistry, blood cell count) and any AE (adverse effect) graded by using CTCAE (Common\n           Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects ) v 4.0 2) Efficacy : progression-free survival\n           and overall survival will be collected. Response rate according to RECIST (Response\n           Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1,1 guideline will also be evaluated 3) PFS\n           (Progression free survival): time from randomization to tumor progression or death 4)\n           OS (Overall survival) : time from randomization to death or last follow-up 5) Biomarker\n           analysis; The correlation between blood level, protein expression of angiopoietin 2,\n           BiP, Hsp90\xce\xb1 and clinical response will be explored."

    publictitle "Visualization of Rectal Cancer During Endoscopy, Using a Fluorescent Tracer"
    briefsummary "To improve rectal cancer management, there is a need for better visualization of drug\n      targets in rectal cancer to identify patients who might benefit from specific targeted\n      treatments. Molecular imaging of rectal cancer associated targets is a promising technique\n      to accommodate this need. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which is differentially\n      expressed in normal versus malignant colon tissue, has proven to be a valid target for\n      molecular imaging. Fluorescent labeling of bevacizumab (a VEGF targeting humanized\n      monoclonal antibody currently used in anti-cancer therapy) using IRDye800CW (a fluorescent\n      dye) has potential advantages in view of safety, infrastructure, costs, stability and\n      imaging resolution. Therefore, the fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW has been\n      developed at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) and was recently approved to be\n      administered to patients in a tracer dose. To detect this tracer in vivo in patients with\n      colorectal cancer, a newly developed flexible near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence endoscope and\n      optoacoustic endoscope have been developed which can be used in clinical studies. Optical\n      fluorescence imaging may support response evaluation following chemoradiotherapy and give\n      insight which patient might benefit from anti-VEGF targeted therapy in future studies."

    publictitle "RAS Switch in Patients With Metastatic RAS Native Colorectal Tumors Treated With 1st Line FOLFIRI-Cetuximab"
    briefsummary "Adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum is a common, serious disease and it is the second\n      cause of death from cancer in Spain.\n\n      The prognosis of CRC depends to a great extent on its stage when diagnosed. Patients with\n      advanced disease, who present up to 40% of all patients, have a poor prognosis. Although the\n      application of modern chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments obtains median survival\n      periods of around 24 months, the proportion of patients with advanced disease who obtain a\n      cure is low.\n\n      Systemic treatment of advanced CRC has changed considerably in the last ten years with the\n      introduction of active drugs such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and capecitabine. The most\n      commonly used first line regimens are 5-Fluorouracil-Leucovorin-Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX),\n      Capecitabine-Oxaliplatin (XELOX), 5-Fluorouracil-Leucovorin-Irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and, to a\n      lesser extent, Capecitabine-Irinotecan (XELIRI). Chemotherapy regimens are combined with\n      different agents against therapeutic targets, three of which are effective in colon cancer:\n      bevacizumab, which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cetuximab or\n      panitumumab, which target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).\n\n      The use of cetuximab and panitumumab is not recommended in patients with KRAS mutations and\n      the combination of a VEGF and EGFR agents is not beneficial.\n\n      Two recent studies results have identified KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of acquired\n      resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab in colorectal cancer patients. The conclusions\n      indicate that the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected non-invasively months\n      before radiographic progression by a DNA Blood Test (Inostics\xc2\xb4BEAMing Technology).\n\n      Centro Integral Oncol\xc3\xb3gico Clara Campal (CIOCC) is aiming to undertake a pioneer project\n      aimed at integrating the analysis of KRAS switch status by BEAMing Technology in patients\n      with metastatic colorectal cancer, tumor KRAS wild-type and BEAMing wild-type treated with\n      first line FOLFIRI-cetuximab\n\n      In naive chemotherapy tumor-KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients, who are\n      BEAMing positive (KRAS mutated in blood) before treatment may have worse evolution in terms\n      of PFS (progression Free Survival) and response rate than BEAMing negative (KRAS native in\n      blood) patients.\n\n      To know the proportion of patients who are BEAMing positive (KRAS mutation can be detected\n      in circulating extracellular DNA) at the beginning of treatment, could be of great\n      importance for treatment efficacy."

    briefsummary "The treatment of the most common cancers (colon, breast, lung, liver and kidney) has\n      recently added a new therapeutic class known as the &#34;anti-angiogenic&#34;. It was born from a\n      better understanding of tumor growth requires the development of neo-vessels. These new\n      vessels are of major importance for the viability of the tumor but also the birth of\n      metastases. This neo-angiogenesis is complex and results from an imbalance between\n      pro-angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic factors. Growth factor VEGF and its receptors\n      (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) are a way of survival of endothelial cells required for tumor\n      neoangiogenesis. The anti-angiogenic drugs currently available on the market are bevacizumab\n      (Avastin \xc2\xae), sunitinib (Sutent \xc2\xae) and sorafenib (Nexavar \xc2\xae). The mechanism of\n      anti-angiogenic action of these three main drugs are pharmacological inhibition of the VEGF\n      pathway.\n\n      These new anti-angiogenic therapies, however, have significant adverse effects are common\n      and some other more serious but rare.\n\n      Hypertension is the most common side effect observed in patients treated with anti-VEGF.\n      This is usually iatrogenic hypertension controlled by antihypertensive therapy and rarely\n      compromises the pursuit of anti-angiogenic therapy. More rarely, it can have serious\n      consequences malignant hypertension, severe hypertension refractory reversible posterior\n      leukoencephalopathy associated with severe hypertension have also been reported.\n\n      The pathophysiology of hypertension may be due to the neutralization of major physiological\n      effects of VEGF in endothelial cell and therefore the vascular wall.\n\n      The study of the microcirculation is not only useful in the diagnosis of microvascular but\n      also macrovascular disease in the evaluation of chronic arterial and venous severe it\n      determines the prognosis. In these indications, capillaroscopy remains the gold standard for\n      all work pathophysiological because visualization of phenomena measured avoids artifacts and\n      difficulties of interpretation. It then appealed to additional technology to directly\n      measure the capillary pressure, capillary flow velocity, and indirectly assess capillary\n      permeability and function of lymphatic canaliculi. The simplest of these technological\n      inputs: video microscopy and digital image analysis, have also improved the practice of\n      routine clinical capillaroscopy in its main field of application, evaluation of\n      microangiopathy connective. The examination can be performed more quickly and easily\n      archived and quantified.\n\n      Only two studies on 14 and 16 patients were able to see a decrease in capillary density\n      correlated with the therapeutic activity of anti-angiogenic the tumor mass and metastasis.\n\n      Thus, we propose to quantify in a number of relatively large patient patients the decrease\n      in capillary density as well as the relationship between the decrease in the number of\n      capillaries and anti-tumor response.\n\n      The study will also aim to measure the prevalence of hypertension in patients treated with\n      bevacizumab and to establish the link between these data and the modification of the\n      capillary microcirculation."

    briefsummary "Bevacizumab (called also Avastin \xc2\xae) is a medicine preventing the creation of new blood\n      vessels (a process called &#34;angiogenesis&#34;). This can reduce blood flow of the tumor and then\n      decreasing the contribution of nutriments and oxygen to the cancer cells and prevent the\n      tumor from growing.\n\n      In various types of cancers, as lung, breast, colorectal and renal cancer, addition of the\n      bevacizumab to chemotherapy allowed to improve the disease outcome. The bevacizumab already\n      benefits from a marketing authorization (MMA) for these various types of cancers.\n\n      The bevacizumab has also obtained MMA for the treatment of the ovarian cancer in its most\n      frequent histological form (ovarian carcinoma). Clinical trials conducted in this indication\n      demonstrated the importance to pursue the treatment by bevacizumab after the chemotherapy is\n      ended.\n\n      This anti-angiogenic medicine is thought to be of a potential interest in sex cords- stromal\n      since this tumors are very well vascularized.\n\n      The ALIENOR study aims to explore the interest and the clinical benefit of associating\n      bevacizumab to the paclitaxel in order to treat patients suffering from recurring sex cords-\n      stromal tumor treated beforehand by platinum chemotherapy"

Part 1 of the study\n      will consist of dose-escalation cohorts, following a 3 + 3 enrollment scheme. Part 2 of the\n      study will consist of expansion cohorts to investigate safety and clinical activity of\n      dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab and trametinib plus dabrafenib in combination\n      with panitumumab. Part 3 of the study will be a randomized Phase II study comparing dosing\n      with dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab and trametinib plus dabrafenib in\n      combination with panitumumab as compared to the chemotherapy comparator (a regimen of\n      leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil,\n      irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) or irinotecan with or without panitumumab or\n      bevacizumab). Subjects will be assigned to treatment groups in a randomized fashion to\n      compare safety and clinical activity. Part 4 of the study will investigate the\n      trametinib/panitumumab combination, including dose escalation and subsequent cohort\n      expansion in two patient populations: 1) BRAF-mutation V600E positive CRC and 2) subjects\n      with CRC who developed secondary resistance to prior anti-EGFR therapy. The objective of\n      Part 4 is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose/regimen for trametinib dosed in\n      combination with panitumumab in dose escalation and to identify an initial signal of\n      clinical activity in expansion cohorts."

    briefsummary "This randomized phase II trial studies how giving a drug called levocetirizine to patients\n      with colorectal cancer affects their tumor response to capecitabine and bevacizumab.\n      Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks tumor growth by disrupting DNA and RNA\n      synthesis and repair (cell division and survival). Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that\n      blocks the ability of tumors to grow and spread by inhibiting the growth of blood vessels\n      that feed them. Patients with colorectal cancer can develop a resistance to the effects of\n      bevacizumab. Levocetirizine may decrease tumor resistance to bevacizumab. Giving\n      bevacizumab, capecitabine, and levocetirizine dihydrochloride together may be an effective\n      treatment for refractory colorectal cancer."

    briefsummary "Early-stage colorectal cancer(CRC)is localized and resectable, but 20% of the patients have\n      metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and 50% of all patients eventually die of the\n      disease. The most frequent site of colorectal metastases is the liver, which accounts for\n      30% to 60% of cases. In these patients, the extent of liver disease is the main determinant\n      of survival. Hepatectomy is the only potentially curative therapy for colorectal liver\n      metastases (CLM), but when traditional criteria for resectability were used, only 10% of\n      patients were candidates for surgical resection.\n\n      Although adjuvant systemic therapy after resection of primary colorectal tumors is well\n      established, there are relatively few data on the use of postoperative therapy vs. surgery\n      alone in patients who have undergone resection of liver metastases. In this trial, the\n      absolute increase in the 3-year PFS rate with the addition of FOLFOX4 was a modest but\n      significant 9% in patients who had resection (from 33% to 42%; P = .025). For improving\n      survival in patients with CLM, several studies with biologic agents have been tried. The use\n      of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has\n      resulted in increased response rates in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer and\n      improved OS and PFS. In an ongoing phase II trial presented in ASCO 2008, in patients who\n      were potentially curable through resection of liver metastases, perioperative treatment with\n      capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) plus bevacizumab yielded an overall response rate of\n      73% with stable disease in 21% and a mean PFS of 27 months. Response to chemotherapy\n      significantly correlated with a prolonged PFS (P < .001).\n\n      On the basis of these backgrounds, we designed a phase II study to compare the effectiveness\n      of combination chemotherapy with perioperative or postoperative bevacizumab treatment in\n      patients with CLM."

Participants will be\n      self-referred to this study. They will be recruited online via a number of sources,\n      including through the involvement of patient advocacy groups, social media tools,\n      traditional media, physicians, and events to raise awareness of this study. After\n      appropriate informed consent and authorization are obtained, data will be collected directly\n      from subjects in an online survey. Participants will be contacted electronically to complete\n      quarterly follow-up surveys. The follow-up period will be 1 year from responding to the\n      baseline survey. DNA collection will be performed as part of this study. DNA will be\n      extracted from saliva, which will be provided by the subject utilizing a collection kit sent\n      to the participants for at-home use."

CEUS was performed before and immediately after 4 courses of\n      chemotherapy and one day before surgery. The number of microvessels highlighted by anti-CD34\n      antibody in the viable tumor tissue was counted to quantify the microvessel density (MVD).\n      As a control, 10 surgical specimens from 10 patients who had not received chemotherapy were\n      examined."

    publictitle "Study of Immune Response and Liver Damage Induced by Chemotherapy for Liver Metastases of Colorectal Cancer"
    briefsummary "The immune response at primary tumor has a major role in the prognosis of colorectal cancer\n      (CRC). Some studies suggest a prognosis value of cytotoxic T cell and memory T cells at\n      primary tumor greater than tumoral stage. There is no work in the literature that has\n      examined the prognosis value of the immune response in liver metastases. To study immune\n      cells (histology) and inflammatory response (cytokines) in liver metastases is a challenge\n      to understand the effectiveness of chemotherapy used in this situation.\n\n      The chemotherapy used in liver metastases of colorectal cancer also have effects on\n      non-tumoral liver tumor and therefore can interfere with postoperative complications of\n      hepatic resection. Sinusoidal dilatation is present in 20% to 80% of patients who received\n      oxaliplatin before hepatectomy. Steatosis is frequently observed after administration of\n      5-FU alone or in combination with irinotecan. This steatosis may also be accompanied by\n      inflammatory lesions (steatohepatitis), especially after administration of oxaliplatin or\n      irinotecan and is associated with increased postoperative mortality. The hepatic toxicity of\n      new biological agents is not well known (cetuximab and bevacizumab). The mechanisms of\n      chemotherapy-induced toxicities are currently unknown. The main objective is to analyze the\n      profile of the immune response in liver metastases of CRC and find the link with the\n      radiological response. Measurements will be made by quantitative RT-PCR on frozen liver\n      biopsies. Secondary objective is to seek a correlation between the histological lesions\n      induced by chemotherapy and non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis. The secondary endpoints\n      are rate of immune cells, histologic response (percentage of tumor necrosis), disease-free\n      survival, the non-invasive test of fibrosis, the chemotherapy-induced liver injury,\n      cytokines and circulating angiogenic factors."

    publictitle "FLO +/- Pazopanib as First-line Treatment in Advanced Gastric Cancer"
    briefsummary "The prognosis of advanced gastric cancer and adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal (GE)\n      junction is poor. Even with modern chemotherapy the median survival ranges around 8-10\n      months.\n\n      Inhibition of neoangiogenesis seems to be a very promising approach in gastric cancer.\n\n      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) acts as one of the most potent stimulating agents\n      of angiogenesis, and several strategies targeting the VEGF signaling pathway have been\n      developed, including anti-VEGF antibodies, soluble receptors binding directly to VEGF\n      ligand, anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) antibodies and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The\n      breakthrough in the clinical development of anti-angiogenic therapy against colorectal\n      cancer came in 2003 with a large prospective, randomized clinical trial of bevacizumab, a\n      monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF. Anti-angiogenic therapy has introduced a highly\n      effective, completely new mode of action in this area and is the new standard of care in\n      advanced colorectal cancer.\n\n      The concept of VEGF inhibition is also very promising in gastric cancer. Bevacizumab was\n      investigated in combination with irinotecan and cisplatin in a phase-II trial, including 47\n      patients with gastric and GE-junction carcinoma. Bevacizumab could safely be given and could\n      improve time to tumor progression by 75% compared to historical controls. Several phase-II\n      trials confirm the tolerability and promising efficacy of bevacizumab in gastric cancer\n      (Bevacizumab + Docetaxel/Oxaliplatin; FOLFOX + Bevacizumab; Docetaxel/Cisplatin/Irinotecan +\n      Bevacizumab). These results were so promising that randomized phase-III trials in the\n      1st-line and perioperative setting are under way (AVAGAST-trial: Cisplatin /Capecitabine +/-\n      bevacizumab 1st line ; MAGIC-B-trial : ECX +/- bevacizumab perioperative).\n\n      Tyrosin kinase inhibitors which inhibit VEGF receptors and EGFR are also investigated in\n      gastric cancer with promising efficacy. Pazopanib, an orally available tyrosine kinase\n      inhibitor, selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2\n      and -3, c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), which results in\n      inhibition of angiogenesis in tumors in which these receptors are upregulated. Pazopanib has\n      the advantage of being an orally available anti-angiogenesis component.\n\n      Pazopanib shows promising activity in phase-II trials in renal cell cancer, breast cancer,\n      soft tissue sarcoma and non small cell lung cancer. A phase-III trial of pazopanib in renal\n      cell cancer (NCT00334282) is completed and resulted in the approval of Pazopanib for this\n      disease. A phase-III trial in soft tissue sarcoma (NCT00753688) is currently performed.\n\n      In phase-I trials, pazopanib was investigated in combination with FOLFOX and\n      Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin. FOLFOX could be administered in full dose with 800 mg pazopanib.\n      In Cape/Ox, capecitabine had to be reduced to 850mg/m\xc2\xb2 bd.\n\n      5-FU- and oxaliplatin-based regimens are one of the established treatment standards for\n      1st-line therapy in metastatic gastric cancer. The efficacy of 5-FU, leukovorin and\n      oxaliplatin (FLO) compared to 5-FU, cisplatin could be confirmed in a randomized phase-III\n      trial of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie (AIO). FLO has a favorable\n      toxicity profile. In Germany, FLO is a widely used combination for advanced gastric cancer\n      and is a recommended regimen in the new German S3-guidelines 2011.\n\n      The investigators therefore want to examine FLO + pazopanib."

VEGF is made by\n      tumor and other surrounding cells to help make blood vessels needed for the growth and\n      spread of cancer cells in the body. The way that bevacizumab works is to stop the cancer\n      cells from making their own blood supply, causing the tumor to stop growing bigger or from\n      spreading. In adult clinical trials, bevacizumab has shown promising anti-cancer activity in\n      patients with cancer of the colon/rectum (colorectal) and breast. It has been approved by\n      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with colorectal cancer but not in\n      cancers found in children. Bevacizumab has been tested in early clinical studies in children\n      and has been shown to be safe.\n\n      Other goals of this study will include research tests designed to test the following changes\n      in the patient or their cancer: to see how the body handles and breaks down bevacizumab\n      (pharmacokinetics), to look at changes in proteins in the blood that may affect the way the\n      cancer responds to the combination (angiogenic profile, angiogenesis associated serum\n      biomarkers), to look at changes in genes that may affect how the cancer responds to\n      treatment with this combination of medications (metabolic signature), and to monitor the\n      effects of changes in the way the body grows and develops before and after bevacizumab is\n      given.&#34;"

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan\n      hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,\n      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such\n      as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor\n      cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing\n      substances to them. Giving bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy may be a\n      better way to block tumor growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is\n      more effective when given together with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with\n      colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving bevacizumab\n      together with first-line chemotherapy and to see how well it works in treating older\n      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer."

    publictitle "Randomized Trial With Dendritic Cells in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer"
    briefsummary "The different alternatives used since 1996 to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) have\n      increased the mean survival of these patients. This outstanding advance is due to the\n      extended indications for resection of hepatic metastases and to the use of new\n      chemotherapeutic drugs (fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) and monoclonal\n      antibodies (bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab). However, none of these treatments is\n      curative and the majority of patients are overwhelmed by the illness. The first line of\n      treatment for MCRC is FOLFOX and the second, irinotecan plus cetuximab for patients with\n      wild type KRAS gene (60%) with a 30% responses, and bevacizumab plus irinotecan with a 5-10%\n      of responses, in patients with mutated KRAS (40%). A treatment with autologous dendritic\n      cells (DCs) pulsed with autologous tumour antigens is proposed as a third line of therapy. A\n      randomized phase II trial would be performed, by selecting two groups of patients, one of\n      them would be treated with the best supportive treatment and the other with DCs plus the\n      best supportive treatment. The aim of the study would be to analyze the outcome after 4\n      months of treatment. In patients treated with DCs, IFN-\xce\xb3 spot forming cells and\n      proliferative responses would be determined pre and post treatment in lymphocytes stimulated\n      with autologous DCs pulsed with autologous tumour antigens. Pre and post treatment serum\n      levels of IFN-\xce\xb3, TNF-\xce\xb1, TGF-\xce\xb2 e IL-12, would also be measured."

    publictitle "Gemcitabine-UFTE Chemotherapy in Refractory Colorectal Cancer"
    briefsummary "Although there have been remarkable advances in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent\n      colorectal cancer (MRCRC), long term survival cannot be expected in most patients with MRCRC\n      because of inevitably developing resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs except some MRCRC\n      patients who can undergo complete resection (metastasectomy). Until now, approved cytotoxic\n      drugs for treatment of MCRC are only 3 categories (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and\n      irinotecan). Recently, molecularly targeted drugs are approved for MRCRC patients, and\n      bevacizumab and cetuximab (for K-ras wild type tumors) are available. When cytotoxic and\n      targeted drugs are appropriately combined, about 24 months of overall survival (OS) can be\n      expected in patients with MRCRC. However, when these drugs are all used or patients cannot\n      afford to receive expensive targeted drugs because of economical problems, there is no\n      option for chemotherapy and best supportive care is the only option, although some patients\n      still have good performance status and medical conditions. Therefore, there are unmet needs\n      for additional salvage chemotherapy regimens for patients with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and\n      fluoropyrimidine-refractory MRCRC.\n\n      In some previous studies, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy showed some antitumor activities in\n      MRCRC patients. Especially, when combined with fluoropyrimidine, gemcitabine has been shown\n      to exert synergic effects on antitumor activities. On these backgrounds, this phase 2\n      clinical study was designed. In this study, efficacy and safety of gemcitabine plus UFTE\n      chemotherapy will be evaluated in MRCRC patients."

Drugs\n      used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and\n      fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing\n      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Sorafenib\n      tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell\n      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor\n      cells to grow and spread. Sorafenib tosylate and bevacizumab may also block tumor growth in\n      different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving sorafenib tosylate and bevacizumab\n      together with combination chemotherapy may be a better treatment for colorectal cancer."

    publictitle "Panitumumab After Resection of Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer in KRAS Wild-type Patients"
    briefsummary "Up to 50% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) develop liver metastasis during the\n      course of their disease. In 30-40% of patients metastasis is confined to the liver. In these\n      patients R0-resection of metastases may contribute to marked improvement of overall\n      survival. Primary resection of liver metastasis is possible in about 15-20% of patients\n      (Scheele 2005, Petrelli 2005). Recent studies indicate that perioperative chemotherapy may\n      improve survival after resection of liver metastases (Portier 2007, Nordlinger 2007).\n      Nevertheless, there is evidence that 70-80% of patients have recurrent disease after\n      resection of liver metastasis. Stratification for the risk of recurrence may be performed\n      using the FONG-score (Fong 1999).\n\n      This study is designed to investigate the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy combined\n      with an anti-EGFR treatment using panitumumab.\n\n      The majority of patients present to the surgeon after chemotherapeutic pretreatment with\n      various not necessarily standardized regimens. Also postoperative therapy after resection of\n      liver metastasis is not a clearly defined standard of care in Germany.\n\n      Based on the study by Nordlinger et al. an oxaliplatin-based regimen is chosen for\n      postoperative therapy (Nordlinger 2008). For reasons of practicability mFOLFOX6 was selected\n      as the chemotherapy backbone for additive treatment (Allegra 2010).\n\n      Also, there is evidence that the combination of FOLFOX with panitumumab is associated with\n      enhanced antitumor activity (Douillard et al. ESMO 2009). The experimental treatment arm\n      will therefore evaluate the combination of FOLFOX plus panitumumab. Since in colorectal\n      cancer monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR are not active in KRAS mutant\n      patients, the experimental arm including panitumumab will only be performed in KRAS\n      wild-type patients (Amado 2008).\n\n      The planned study aims to assess the efficacy of postoperative therapy with FOLFOX plus\n      panitumumab followed by maintenance with panitumumab for 3 months in KRAS wild-type\n      patients, compared to the historical data for standard FOLFOX chemotherapy alone, which are\n      verified by a randomised control group without the antibody. (Figure 1: Study Design).\n\n      The study will allow preoperative treatment with regimens such as FOLFIRI, XELIRI, FOLFOX or\n      XELOX +/-bevacizumab or +/- cetuximab. However, only those patients will be considered\n      eligible who did not progress during preoperative therapy.\n\n      After surgery, a treatment-free interval of at least 4 weeks, but no longer than 8 weeks\n      will be granted.\n\n      KRAS-wild-type patients (60% of all pts) will then be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to an\n      experimental arm with FOLFOX + panitumumab or to a reference arm with FOLFOX alone.\n      Combination treatment will be performed for a duration of 3 months, after which patients in\n      the experimental arm will receive maintenance therapy with panitumumab for further 3 months.\n      In the reference arm, treatment will, however, be ended after 3 months."

    publictitle "Hepatic Arterial Chemotherapy With Raltitrexed and Oxaliplatin Versus Standard Chemotherapy in Unresectable Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer After Conventional Chemotherapy Failure"
    briefsummary "Standard treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers relies on fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan\n      alone or in association with fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin in association with\n      fluoropyrimidines, bevacizumab and anti EGFR antibodies. After failure of classical regimen\n      the national reference frame on the basis of phase II study proposes an association of\n      fluoropyrimidine and mitomycin. These treatments give response rates of 10-20% with\n      progression free survivals from 2 to 3 months. Hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy is\n      logical in the case of isolated hepatic metastases nonaccessible to curative resection: 1)\n      hepatic metastases are vascularized by hepatic arterial system in contrast to nontumoral\n      hepatic parenchyma; 2) arterial perfusion of oxaliplatin leads to a strong extraction by the\n      liver during the first passage, a high intra-tumoral concentration and a low systemic\n      concentration. So oxaliplatin is a drug of choice for arterial treatment but combination\n      with fluoropyrimidines is impossible because of need for prolonged perfusion. Floxuridin is\n      not available in France. Raltitrexed, a definitive inhibitor of the thymidylate synthase,\n      does not require a prolonged perfusion and could be a good substitute.In a previous pilot\n      study we demonstrated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of combination of raltitrexed and\n      oxaliplatin arterial perfusion. Now we propose a phase II randomized clinical trial to\n      evaluate the efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion of raltitrexed and oxaliplatin\n      association versus standard chemotherapy for patients with metastases of colorectal origin\n      restricted to the liver after failure of conventional chemotherapy."

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin\n      calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), work in different ways to stop the growth\n      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal\n      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the\n      ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry\n      tumor-killing substances to them. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90\n      DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A, can find tumor cells and carry tumor-killing\n      substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody\n      before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs\n      to be removed. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy after surgery may kill any\n      tumor cells that remain after surgery"

Definition of optimized treatment algorithms is difficult due to very inhomogeneous\n      patient populations.\n\n      This open label, multicentre Phase II study primarily aims to assess the resection rate\n      achievable in a selected patient population with initially unresectable metastatic disease\n      limited to the liver only in order to evaluate feasibility, safety and efficacy with regards\n      to secondary resection of hepatic lesions in these patients.\n\n      The trial aims to enrol only patients meeting defined criteria of unresectability with\n      regards to their hepatic lesions and will exclude patients with extrahepatic lesions in\n      order to examine the most appropriate, highly active treatment regimen for this group of\n      unresectable patients with the highest probability of a successful secondary metastasectomy\n      with curative intent. The trial will be conducted in highly specialized centres with a track\n      record of successful interdisciplinary treatment approaches in the field of metastatic\n      colorectal cancer to allow the precise assessment of the peri-operative safety parameters as\n      well as an evaluation of the surgical treatment approaches.\n\n      The IXO regimen selected for this study has shown in a phase I/II study promising efficacy\n      and a favourable safety profile. Bevacizumab has demonstrated a significant survival benefit\n      in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. Therefore the study will\n      allow evaluation of its potential benefit in combination with the two most active current\n      chemotherapy regimens in the first-line and post-operative treatment setting."

Giving\n      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving the drugs in different combinations\n      may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, can\n      block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and\n      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to\n      them. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab or cetuximab may kill more\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE:To evaluate the use of standard (KRAS) and experimental (thymidine phosphorylase,\n      ERCC1 and BRAF) tumor testing can aid in selecting chemotherapy regimens"

    briefsummary "This is a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness and safety of the combination of\n      the study drugs bevacizumab and AMG386 in patients with advanced (metastatic)\n      chemotherapy-naive bowel (colorectal) cancer. Chemotherapy has a significant impact in\n      metastatic bowel cancer in terms of maintenance of quality of life and extension of\n      survival. However, ultimately tumours will develop resistance to these agents and further\n      treatment options are urgently required.\n\n      Angiogenesis is a process that results in the formation of new blood vessels. Similar to\n      normal tissues, solid tumours require new blood vessels for growth and survival. Hence,\n      drugs targeting angiogenesis may be useful treatment options for patients with bowel cancer.\n\n      AMG386 and bevacizumab act on 2 different pathways relevant to angiogenesis. There is\n      evidence from laboratory and animal studies to suggest that such a combination could be\n      useful as a cancer treatment. Previous studies in humans have shown that AMG386 and\n      bevacizumab can be combined safely.. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and\n      safety of the combination of AMG386 and bevacizumab in patients with advanced bowel cancer.\n\n      40 patients from approximately four hospitals in Australia will participate in this trial,\n      with approximately 20 patients being enrolled at Austin Health. All participants will\n      receive the same treatment."

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find tumor cells and either kill them or\n      carry tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving radioactive\n      substances together with antibodies may be effective treatment for some advanced cancers.\n      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, fluorouracil, and leucovorin\n      calcium (FOLFIRI), work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by\n      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as\n      bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells\n      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing\n      substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood\n      flow to the tumor. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies together with combination\n      chemotherapy and bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of\n      yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen) monoclonal antibody M5A when given\n      together with combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab in treating patients with metastatic\n      colorectal cancer."

    briefsummary "This phase II trial is studying how well giving high-dose cholecalciferol works in treating\n      patients receiving combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab as first-line therapy for\n      metastatic colorectal cancer. Cholecalciferol during treatment may delay the development of\n      colorectal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and\n      oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the\n      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can\n      block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and\n      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to\n      them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the\n      tumor. Giving cholecalciferol together with combination chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody\n      therapy may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer"

    briefsummary "This study is being done to determine the maximum dose of a certain chemotherapy drug\n      (irinotecan) that can be tolerated as part of a combination of drugs. There is a combination\n      of chemotherapy drugs typically used to treat cancer of the colon and rectum: 5-Flurouracil\n      (5-FU), leucovorin, and irinotecan; the combination is known as FOLFIRI. At the present\n      time, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this drug combination for the\n      treatment of cancers of the colon and rectum. The FDA has also approved the use of a drug\n      called bevacizumab (or Avastin) in combination with FOLFIRI, and this is considered one of\n      the standards of care for all patients with colon and rectal cancer which has spread.\n\n      The best dose of irinotecan to use in the combination of FOLFIRI and bevacizumab is not\n      known. Earlier studies have shown that higher doses of irinotecan can be used safely as part\n      of the FOLFIRI combination, but it is unclear whether these same doses will be safe when\n      bevacizumab is added to this combination."

MK-0646 is an investigational or experimental anti-cancer agent that has\n      not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in metastatic\n      colorectal cancer or any other disease.\n\n      This study will assess whether adding MK-0646 to an FDA-approved standard of care\n      chemotherapy improves participants' duration of progression-free survival. MK-0646 is\n      believed to inhibit the receptor of a protein called IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor)\n      which is thought to contribute to cancer development and growth. However, there is no\n      guarantee that MK-0646 will slow cancer development and growth.\n\n      Other purposes of this study include:\n\n        -  looking at the safety and tolerability of MK-0646\n\n        -  comparing MK-0646 + standard of care chemotherapy with placebo + standard of care\n           chemotherapy (placebo is a substance that looks like an active drug but has no active\n           ingredient) The standard of care chemotherapy in this study is called FOLFOX 7.

Giving mitomycin C after surgery may kill any remaining tumor\n      cells. It is not yet known whether standard therapy is more effective with or without\n      surgery followed by mitomycin C.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying standard therapy with or without\n      surgery and mitomycin C in treating patients with advanced limited peritoneal dissemination\n      of colon cancer"

However, patients may withdraw from the study at any time upon their own request.\n      Treatment with preoperative chemothera\xc2\xacpy will continue until 2-4 weeks prior to surgery\n      with the last application of bevacizumab (only FOLFOXIRI) 4 weeks before surgery, at longest\n      16 cycles (= 32 weeks) for candidates not eli\xc2\xacgible for surgery.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and ramucirumab, can block tumor growth\n      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find\n      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab and\n      ramucirumab may also stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the\n      tumor. It is not yet know whether giving cetuximab and irinotecan hydrochloride together is\n      more effective with or without ramucirumab in treating colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving\n      cetuximab and irinotecan hydrochloride with or without ramucirumab work in treating patients\n      with advanced colorectal cancer with progressive disease after treatment with\n      bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy."

    publictitle "RAD001, FOLFOX and Bevacizumab in Treatment of Colorectal Carcinoma"
    briefsummary "RAD001 (everolimus) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin. RAD001 has been in clinical\n      development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation and has\n      obtained marketing authorization (Certican\xc2\xae) for prophylaxis of rejection in renal and\n      cardiac transplantation in a number of countries, including the majority of the European\n      Union. RAD001 has been in development for patients with various malignancies since 2002.\n\n      RAD001 is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:\n\n        -  Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation\n\n        -  Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent\n           inhibition of tumor cell HIF-1 activity, VEGF production and VEGF-induced proliferation\n           of endothelial cells). The role of angiogenesis in the maintenance of solid tumor\n           growth is well established, and the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the regulation\n           of tumor production of proangiogenic factors as well as modulation of VEGFR signaling\n           in endothelial cells.\n\n      At weekly and daily schedules and at various doses explored, RAD001 is generally well\n      tolerated. The most frequent adverse events (rash, mucositis, fatigue and headache)\n      associated with RAD001 therapy are manageable. Non-infectious pneumonitis has been reported\n      with mTOR inhibitors but is commonly low-grade and reversible.\n\n      Both FOLFOX and bevacizumab are well established for treatment of metastatic colorectal\n      carcinomas. FOLFOX-6 can be combined safely with Bevacizumab and is currently in phase 3\n      testing for adjuvant therapy and is commonly used as a first line treatment regimen for\n      metastatic colorectal cancers 25. There is an enhanced interest in development of more\n      effective regimens for colorectal cancers. RAD001 is a mTOR inhibitor that has preclinical\n      and clinical activity in colorectal cancers. RAD001 downregulates the mTOR pathway which can\n      lead to direct antiproliferative effects as well as decreased production of Vascular\n      Endothelial Growth Factor. A combination of RAD001 at 10 mg per day in combination with\n      Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks has been shown to be efficacious and safe. In another\n      trial, RAD001 was shown to have many patients with stable disease and clearly needs to be\n      given in combination therapy."

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and oxaliplatin, work in\n      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping\n      them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in\n      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor\n      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also\n      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Hydroxychloroquine may\n      help chemotherapy and bevacizumab work better and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving hydroxychloroquine together with\n      capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab works in treating patients with metastatic\n      colorectal cancer."

    briefsummary "The purpose of this research is to determine whether the drug, Bevacizumab (a monoclonal\n      anti VEGF-A antibody), which is approved to treat patients with metastatic colon cancer\n      induces hyperprolactinemia (increased prolactin secretion) in humans with intact pituitary\n      function. Past studies have shown Bevacizumab to shrink tumor size and also increase\n      prolactin levels. The mechanism of the hyperprolactinemia might be inhibition of pituitary\n      portal vein transport, suggesting that Bevacizumab induces prolactin secretion from normal\n      lactotrophs in the pituitary gland.\n\n      Patients who have been treated with Bevacizumab for at least one month will be recruited to\n      participate.\n\n      The subjects who are being treated with Bevacizumab by Dr. Stephen Wolin (a\n      sub-investigator) will be screened by him for study eligibility. Dr. Wolin will approach\n      eligible patients with all the information and background of the study and see if they have\n      an interest in being consented.\n\n      If consented, there will be 2 blood draws for the research that is not part of their\n      standard care in which 10 ml of blood is collected and prolactin, growth hormone, IGF-I,\n      TSH, thyroxine, ACTH, and cortisol will be measured. One 5ml blood draw will occur before\n      the administration of Bevacizumab and the second 5 ml blood draw will occur after the\n      administration of the Bevacizumab. The investigators will then review the laboratory\n      results. The blood tests are of the hormones of the pituitary gland to test pituitary\n      function and see if there are any abnormalities with the secretions of the gland. Pituitary\n      function abnormalities and hyperprolactinemia are diagnosed by looking at hormone levels in\n      the blood and comparing them to the normal reference ranges.\n\n      This study will only involve 10 subjects and will be conducted entirely at Cedars-Sinai\n      Medical Center."

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium,\n      and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by\n      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of\n      colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving\n      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) is more effective when given with or without\n      bevacizumab in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving combination chemotherapy with or\n      without bevacizumab to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic colorectal\n      cancer."

    briefsummary "If residual breast cancer is found in the breast or lymph node tissue removed after\n      preoperative chemotherapy, one may be at increased risk of breast cancer recurrence in the\n      future. The purpose of this research study is to determine if having additional treatment\n      after preoperative chemotherapy and surgery with bevacizumab and metronomic chemotherapy\n      would make a difference in reducing the participants chance of breast cancer recurrence\n      compared to the standard of care, which is observation alone. This study will evaluate the\n      potential additional benefits from participating in an exercise and dietary intervention\n      compared to the dietary intervention alone. Bevacizumab is an antibody that is made in the\n      laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Bevacizumab\n      works to slow or stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to\n      tumors. Bevacizumab has been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration to treat\n      advanced colorectal, lung and kidney cancers. Metronomic chemotherapy also attacks tumor\n      blood supply. Standard chemotherapy drugs are used, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate (CM),\n      but in very small daily doses by mouth, well below the threshold where they can cause people\n      to feel sick. Previous research studies have shown that women with breast cancer who take\n      metronomic CM and bevacizumab feel very well, and the combination therapy is active in\n      reducing their cancer. Participants in this study will also be provided with diet or diet\n      and exercise counseling over the telephone. Studies have shown that many women who are\n      treated for breast cancer will gain weight during and after their treatment, and may also\n      experience fatigue and weakness. Many studies have shown that making changes in diet and\n      increasing exercise can help prevent weight gain and also may increase energy and decrease\n      other side effects of chemotherapy and other breast cancer treatments."

This will occur in the first part of the study (Phase I). Once this\n      dose has been determined, it will be given to subjects with advanced metastatic colorectal\n      cancer in the second part of the study (Phase II).\n\n      By giving these drugs in combination, researchers hope to evaluate the side effects of the\n      study drugs in both groups, and to determine if this combination could possibly decrease or\n      stabilize the cancer being treated.\n\n      Subjects will be enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) and Rocky Mountain Cancer\n      Center.\n\n      After satisfying eligibility and screening criteria, patients will be treated on 21 day\n      cycles.\n\n      ABOUT THE STUDY DRUGS\n\n        -  Capecitabine (Xeloda\xe2\x84\xa2) is an oral (taken by mouth) chemotherapy drug in tablet form\n           made by Roche Laboratories Inc. Capecitabine has been approved for use by the Food and\n           Drug Administration (FDA) for first line treatment (treatment that should be used for\n           cancer that has not been treated yet) of metastatic colorectal cancer and also for\n           metastatic breast cancer.\n\n        -  Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin\xe2\x84\xa2) is an intravenous (given by injection into a vein) chemotherapy\n           drug made by Sanofi-Synth\xc3\xa9labo. This drug is also approved by the FDA for use in\n           metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\n        -  Bevacizumab (Avastin\xe2\x84\xa2) is a type of intravenous cancer treatment called anti-angiogenic\n           therapy (a type of therapy to treat cancer that interferes with blood flow to the\n           tumor, thereby stopping tumor growth, and possibly leading to tumor shrinkage) made by\n           Genentech Inc. Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA for first line treatment of\n           metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other chemotherapy.\n\n        -  Dasatinib (Sprycel\xe2\x84\xa2) is an oral drug made by Bristol Myers Squib, Inc (BMS). Dasatinib\n           is approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute\n           lymphoblastic leukemia or for patients that are resistant to a medicine called imatinib\n           mesylate (Gleevec\xe2\x84\xa2 )."

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can\n      block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and\n      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to\n      them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to\n      the tumor. Giving ursodiol together with leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and\n      bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ursodiol when\n      given together with combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab in treating patients with stage\n      IV colorectal cancer."

In a multivariate analysis, Bevacizumab beyond first progression and exposure to any\n      2nd-line chemotherapy were independently associated with increased overall survival (both p\n      < 0.0001). Bevacizumab beyond progression appears to be associated with longer overall in\n      BRiTE.\n\n      The investigators planned a prospective study to prove this phenomenon of bevacizumab beyond\n      progression."

LBH589 in combination\n      with bevacizumab is a drug combination that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally.\n      LBH589 has been used alone in other trials for solid tumor malignancies. Bevacizumab is FDA\n      approved for use in patients with colorectal cancer and has been studied extensively in\n      other types of solid tumors. The combination of LBH589 and bevacizumab has not yet been\n      studied but information from other studies suggests that the combination may help prevent\n      the growth of the participant's tumor.&#34;"

Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two combination chemotherapy regimens\n      given together with bevacizumab to see how well they work as first-line therapy in treating\n      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery."

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor\n      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies,\n      such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of\n      tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry\n      tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by\n      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab\n      may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving combination chemotherapy\n      together with bevacizumab and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic\n      colorectal cancer."

    publictitle "Bevacizumab and Temozolomide Following Radiation and Chemotherapy for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme"
    briefsummary "b&#34;This study is being conducted to help determine whether the addition of Avastin (an\n      anti-cancer drug), when given along with temozolomide during the monthly cycles that follow\n      radiation, is able to delay tumor growth, shrink tumors, or impact how long people with GBM\n      live. This study is sponsored by Genentech, Inc., the manufacturer of Avastin.\n\n      Avastin is the experimental drug being administered in this research study. Avastin binds a\n      protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. VEGF is produced by tumors and\n      circulates in the blood. One of VEGF's main roles is to support the growth of new blood\n      vessels. During cancer, VEGF promotes the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to\n      tumor cells and help them grow. Avastin binds to VEGF, which then prevents VEGF from\n      functioning. In laboratory studies, Avastin prevented the growth of several different types\n      of cancer cells grown in animals. Avastin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration\n      (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy.\n      Avastin has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of GBM and is, therefore,\n      considered experimental. Avastin is currently undergoing testing (alone and in combination\n      with another anti-cancer drug, irinotecan) in persons with GBM that have come back after\n      conventional treatment.\n\n      Temozolomide (Temodar) is an anti-cancer drug that works by interfering with the growth of\n      cells (including cancer cells) by stopping their division. Temozolomide was approved by the\n      U.S. FDA for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM in 2005.\n\n      Avastin and temozolomide are currently being used together in several research studies\n      involving people with newly diagnosed GBM. Limited information is available about either the\n      safety or effectiveness of this drug combination.&#34;"

    briefsummary "Dose dense chemotherapy, which is the term for Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) followed\n      by Taxol chemotherapy given every two weeks, is the standard chemotherapy for the treatment\n      of ER+ or PR+ breast cancer. In this trial, the standard chemotherapy is being combined with\n      bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is an antibody which works differently from the way other\n      chemotherapy drugs work. Bevacizumab slows or stops cell growth in cancerous tumors by\n      decreasing the blood supply to the tumors by binding to a substance found on cancer cells\n      called VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA for the\n      treatment of colorectal cancer and lung cancer. However, it is not approved for the\n      treatment of breast cancer. Another goal of this research is to determine whether we can\n      develop a way to identify tumors that will respond well to this study treatment."

Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor\n      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also\n      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound\n      with gas-encapsulated microbubbles can be used to assess tumour vascularity, particularly\n      hepatic metastases, and may become a useful tool for monitoring anti-angiogenic therapies.\n      The aim of this prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study is to evaluate the usefulness\n      of hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound to predict response to bevacizumab based\n      chemotherapy in patient with metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary objective of this\n      study is to compare the functional vascular changes related to bevacizumab based\n      chemotherapy and evaluated by hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound with classic RECIST\n      criteria. The secondary objectives are to do a characterization of the pharmacokinetic of\n      bevacizumab, to explore the pharmacodynamic effects of bevacizumab on functional vascular\n      changes of hepatic metastases evaluated by hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound and to\n      analyze the possible relationships between treatment efficacy or toxicity and constitutional\n      gene polymorphisms linked to the bevacizumab."

    briefsummary "Major attempt is being given to the potential of curing patients with metastatic colorectal\n      cancer due to the recognition of dramatic change in survival figures achieved in palliative\n      chemotherapy combination treatment protocols. Achieving resectablity rates in previously\n      unresectable patients has been defined as study endpoint among other well known primary and\n      secondary objectives. Curing metastatic colorectal cancer is most likely in resectable\n      patients and therefore the logical next step after completion of chemotherapy combination\n      studies (e.g. EORTC 40983) is the addition of targeted agents. Bevacizumab has the most\n      valid data of improving outcome figures and was therefore chosen as additional agent. Safety\n      of the combination with Xelox was demonstrated in the investigators pilot trial (Gruenberger\n      JCO 2006, ASCO 2006, WCGC 2006, ESMO 2006), consequently response rate and resection rate\n      will be the primary endpoints in this trial.\n\n      STUDY OBJECTIVES\n\n      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is the Resectability (R0) rate after\n      neoadjuvant Bevacizumab in potentially resectable mCRC.\n\n      Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of this study include\n\n        -  Feasibility with regards to GI bleeding and wound healing complications after surgery\n           of liver metastases\n\n        -  General safety\n\n        -  Overall Response Rate (ORR)\n\n        -  Recurrence Free Survival (RFS)\n\n        -  Overall Survival (OS)\n\n      STUDY DURATION Recruitment is planned for 12 months. Patients will be treated for 6 cycles\n      XELOX and 5 cycles Bevacizumab. Surgery will be performed 2 weeks after the last\n      Capecitabine administration, allowing a time window of 5 weeks between the last Bevacizumab\n      administration and surgery.\n\n      Therapy with 6 cycles of XELOX and Bevacizumab will be restarted 4-5 weeks after surgery.\n\n      With a Follow up period of 2 years after the last enrolled patient, in order to assess RFS\n      and OS, the trial will last for approx. 3 years.\n\n      NUMBER OF CENTRES Four centres with a high level of experience in the surgery of liver\n      metastases are planned to participate in this study.\n\n      SELECTION CRITERIA\n\n      Total Number of Patients and Target Population The planned total sample size for this study\n      is 43 patients.

    briefsummary "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different\n      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and\n      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the\n      growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy may\n      kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more\n      effective when given together with bevacizumab in treating patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying bevacizumab to compare how well it works\n      when given together with two different combination chemotherapy regimens as first-line\n      therapy in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by\n      surgery."

    briefsummary "Background:\n\n        -  Bevacizumab is a genetically engineered antibody that blocks the growth of new blood\n           vessels in tumors. It has shown activity against human brain tumors in laboratory tests\n           and human clinical trials.\n\n        -  Irinotecan causes damage to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in cancer cells so that the\n           cells cannot reproduce or repair themselves. It is approved for treating patients with\n           colorectal cancer.\n\n        -  Bevacizumab and irinotecan in combination are more effective against colon cancer than\n           either drug alone.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        -  To determine the safety of bevacizumab and irinotecan and any side effects associated\n           with the combination of the two drugs when given to patients with high grade gliomas.\n\n        -  To determine if the combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan can help patients with\n           brain tumors that have grown after treatment with bevacizumab alone.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      -Patients 18 years of age and older who have been treated on National Cancer Institute (NCI)\n      trial 06-C-0064 (NCT00271609), &#34;Bevacizumab Alone for Recurrent Gliomas,&#34; and whose tumor\n      has progressed.\n\n      Design:\n\n      Participants receive infusions of bevacizumab and irinotecan through a vein once every 2\n      weeks in 4-week treatment cycles, plus the following procedures:\n\n        -  History, physical and neurological examinations every 2 weeks for the first treatment\n           cycle and then every 4 weeks\n\n        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the head every 4 weeks.\n\n        -  Routine lab every week.\n\n        -  Quality-of-life questionnaire every 4 weeks"

    briefsummary "Primary Objective: This trial is elaborating a model for rapidly predicting (day 21) the\n      response to monoclonal antibodies anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF (cetuximab and bevacizumab) based\n      on biological markers and/or functional imaging. The response to treatment is evaluated by\n      the conventional method after 2 months (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\n      [RECIST] criteria).\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        1. This trial is also analyzing the correlation between the magnitude of response to\n           treatment at 2 months (stabilization or objective response, RECIST criteria) and that\n           of response observed after 6 months of treatment.\n\n        2. The organisational objective is to develop a tumour bank of metastatic colorectal\n           cancer.\n\n      Population: The population includes 252 male and female patients with metastatic colorectal\n      cancer justifying the use of cetuximab or bevacizumab, with no heart disease.\n\n      Techniques: Computed tomography (CT scan), functional imaging (ultrasound with SonoVue);\n      molecular imaging (positron emission tomography [PET] with fluorodeoxyglucose F18 [18-FDG]);\n      and biology and pathology on microbiopsy of liver metastasis are used.\n\n      Outcome Criteria: The primary outcome is response to treatment with monoclonal antibodies\n      according to RECIST criteria at two months.\n\n      Studied Factors:\n\n      Radiology:\n\n        1. CT scan: RECIST criteria (gold standard);\n\n        2. Ultrasound with SonoVue injection: 1 representative target (delay of contrast\n           appearance, peak of rising, curve of increase and decrease of the signal, area under\n           the curve, time of average transit).\n\n      Nuclear Medicine: PET scan and 18-FDG (standard uptake values [SUV])\n\n      Molecular Characterization of Tumors: p53 status; microsatellite instability (MSI) status;\n      expression of oncogenes; EGFR status; VEGF status; determination of FcgammaRIIIA\n      polymorphisms\n\n      Statistics:\n\n        1. Descriptive analyses;\n\n        2. Analysis of the appropriate threshold to measure: response to treatment by an\n           ultrasound with SonoVue and by PET scan; correlation between response predicted by the\n           ultrasound with SonoVue and the PET; conventional morphological CT at 2 months\n\n        3. Analysis of prognostic factors:\n\n             1. Evaluation of the role of each prognostic factor (pathology and imaging) on\n                response to treatment;\n\n             2. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors;\n\n             3. Analysis of the prognostic power of early response at 2 months on the response\n                observed after 6 months of treatment."

    briefsummary "Although it is possible to cure bowel cancer when it is detected at an early stage, in many\n      cases it may spread to involve other organs and in these cases is generally incurable.\n      Chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves quality of life in such patients, but standard\n      chemotherapy for this disease has not been defined.\n\n      There are several possible chemotherapy treatments for patients with bowel cancer, which has\n      spread to other organs. However, these treatments are only partly effective and only work\n      for a limited period of time. Most treatments are associated with a number of possible side\n      effects which may have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Thus, it is imperative that\n      more effective treatments with the lowest possible risk of side effects are developed.\n\n      Previous studies have shown that the addition of a new type of antibody treatment\n      (bevacizumab) to an intensive combination chemotherapy regimen improved survival in patients\n      with advanced bowel cancer and extended the time before tumours began to grow. However,\n      intensive chemotherapy is likely to only be a suitable treatment for a proportion of\n      patients with bowel cancer, because intensive chemotherapy causes a high rate of side\n      effects.\n\n      This study compares a gentle chemotherapy treatment (capecitabine chemotherapy tablets given\n      by mouth) with the combination of capecitabine and bevacizumab and the combination of\n      capecitabine, bevacizumab and intravenous mitomycin C.\n\n      It is expected that a gentle chemotherapy treatment or a gentle chemotherapy treatment\n      combined with bevacizumab would be an appropriate treatment for both young and fit patients\n      as well as older and less fit patients who would not easily tolerate intensive chemotherapy."

Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find\n      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also\n      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.\n      Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.\n      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan,\n      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Giving monoclonal antibodies together with combination\n      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy\n      is more effective with cetuximab and/or bevacizumab in treating patients with colorectal\n      cancer."

    briefsummary "Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is the fifth most common malignant disorder,\n      with an increasing incidence in Europe and the USA as a result of the high prevalence of\n      hepatitis C. Most patients are not suitable for potentially curative treatment. There is no\n      standard palliative treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as\n      no drug has been demonstrated to be efficient in this disease in terms of survival. The use\n      of anti-vascular agents might be a promising approach in view of the highly vascular nature\n      of this tumor. The aim of this phase II trial is to evaluate the potential benefit of\n      bevacizumab in terms of disease control rate, progression-free and overall survival in adult\n      patients with advanced primary liver cancer. Bevacizumab is an angiogenesis inhibitor\n      already successfully used in patients with colorectal and renal cancers."

    briefsummary "b&#34;This study is for people with colorectal cancer, who have tumors that cannot be completely\n      removed by surgery. This study is being done to find out how long it takes tumors to grow\n      after patients receive the drugs capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. Capecitabine\n      (also called Xeloda) is a drug that has been approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced\n      colorectal cancer. Capecitabine prevents some colorectal cancer cancer cells from\n      reproducing, and causes some of them to die. Oxaliplatin (also called Eloxatin) has also\n      been approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Oxaliplatin prevents\n      some colorectal cancer cells from reproducing. Bevacizumab is an investigational drug.\n      Bevacizumab is an antibody (a protein that acts against a specific substance) directed\n      against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF promotes the growth of blood vessels\n      that bring nutrients to cells. Bevacizumab inhibits the growth of colon cancer cells, by\n      blocking the effects of VEGF. The combination of the drugs used in this study is\n      experimental. The purpose of this study is to see how long it takes patients' tumors to grow\n      when they are taking this combination of drugs.&#34;"

This involves an optimal primary tumor debulking surgery. The most active\n      chemotherapy agents should then be promptly administered. Taxol and Carboplatin or Cisplatin\n      have become the standard&#34; first line&#34; therapy because of proven survival benefits with those\n      regimens in treating advanced ovarian adenocarcinoma patients. New chemotherapy agents like\n      bevacizumab have demonstrated increased overall and progression free survival benefits in\n      metastatic colorectal cancer patients and are being studied for their potential contributory\n      impact on the current standard of treatment. Since no triplet regimen has demonstrated\n      compelling superiority, the combination of taxol, carboplatin, and bevacizumab is intriguing\n      because of their potential synergy, distinct mechanisms of action, and non-overlapping\n      toxicity.\n\n      The null hypothesis (Ho) is that the drug regimen will demonstrate an 80% patient response\n      rate (RR).\n\n      The alternative Hypothesis (H1): The triplet drug regimen will demonstrate a significantly\n      higher patient response rate than standard therapy.\n\n      Hypothesis (H2): The triplet drug regimen will demonstrate a significantly more favorable\n      patient time to tumor progression rate than standard therapy."

Monoclonal antibodies,\n      such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of\n      tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry\n      tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab (Bv) may also stop the growth of tumor cells\n      by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with\n      bevacizumab after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet\n      known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab is more effective\n      than combination chemotherapy alone in treating colon cancer in adjuvant setting.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different combination chemotherapy\n      regimens with or without bevacizumab to compare how well they work in treating patients who\n      have undergone surgery for high risk stage II or stage III colon cancer."

    briefsummary "The study was terminated early due to low enrollment with only 2 subjects enrolled and\n      treated after being open for enrollment for over a year. Therefore, no meaningful efficacy\n      analyses could be performed.\n\n      This trial is studying the effects (good and bad) of a combination of drugs, Irinotecan in\n      combination with infusional 5-FU, leucovorin (FOLFIFI) plus Bevacizumab, for cancer of the\n      colon or rectum that has spread to the liver only and is currently not able to be removed by\n      surgery. All of the drugs that will be received in this research study have been approved in\n      the United States for colorectal cancer, that has spread to other areas of the body,\n      including the liver. Another reason for doing this study is to see if the chemotherapy drugs\n      FOLFIFI plus Bevacizumab can sufficiently decrease the size of the cancer in the liver so\n      that any tumor remaining can be completely removed with surgery and, if it can be removed\n      whether doing so will prolong the time it takes the cancer to return and/or prolong the life\n      of these patients. This trial is also looking at the genes of people who take part in this\n      study, to see if it is possible to find out characteristics that can help predict whose\n      cancer will respond well or not so well, and who will have more or less side effects to this\n      chemotherapy."

We conducted a randomized phase II trial of modified leucovorin, fluorouracil and irinotecan (mFOLFIRI) + bevacizumab and sequential IRIS + bevacizumab as first- or second-line therapies. Sixty metastatic colorectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive mFOLFIRI + bevacizumab or sequential IRIS + bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg of bevacizumab and 150 mg/m(2) of irinitecan, and 80 mg/m(2)/day of S-1 orally from day 3 until day 16 as a 3-week course). The primary endpoint was the safety of each method until week 12, with the secondary endpoint being the comparison of the safety and efficacy of the two methods. The safety of the two treatments was comparable, except that G3 anorexia and diarrhoea were less frequent with sequential IRIS + bevacizumab. The overall response rate was 62% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.1-79.8] versus 72% (95% CI 50.6-86.2), and progression-free survival was 324 days (95% CI 247-475) versus 345 days (95% CI 312-594) with mFOLFIRI + bevacizumab versus IRIS + bevacizumab, respectively. Sequential IRIS + bevacizumab is a safe and effective method of systemic chemotherapy against metastatic colorectal cancer and is compatible with mFOLFIRI + bevacizumab."

    briefsummary "To evaluate panitumumab plus modified fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) or bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 in patients with previously untreated wild-type (WT) KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A prespecified secondary objective was to assess treatment effects in an extended RAS analysis that included exons 2, 3, and 4 of KRAS and NRAS. Patients with WT KRAS exon 2 tumors were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 or bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and safety. Of 285 randomly assigned patients, 278 received treatment. In the WT KRAS exon 2 intent-to-treat group, PFS was similar between arms (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.17; P = .353). Median OS was 34.2 and 24.3 months in the panitumumab and bevacizumab arms, respectively (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.89; P = .009). In the WT RAS subgroup (WT exons 2, 3, and 4 of KRAS and NRAS), PFS favored the panitumumab arm (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.96; P = .029). Median OS was 41.3 and 28.9 months (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.02; P = .058) in the panitumumab and bevacizumab arms, respectively. Treatment discontinuation rates because of adverse events were similar between arms. PFS was similar and OS was improved with panitumumab relative to bevacizumab when combined with mFOLFOX6 in patients with WT KRAS exon 2 tumors. Patients with WT RAS tumors seemed to experience more clinical benefit with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy."

    briefsummary "Although CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, second-line CRC treatment is limited. In this trial we examined the efficacy and safety of linifanib, an oral, potent, selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor families, with mFOLFOX6, compared with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6, in previously treated metastatic CRC. One hundred forty-eight patients with advanced CRC previously treated with fluoropyrimidine or irinotecan received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, intravenous), low-dose linifanib (7.5 mg), or high-dose linifanib (12.5 mg), with mFOLFOX6. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. No statistically significant differences in PFS occurred between bevacizumab and linifanib doses (low, hazard ratio [HR], 1.453 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.830-2.539]; high, HR, 1.257 [95% CI, 0.672-2.351]). Median OS values were similar for bevacizumab and high-dose linifanib (bevacizumab, 16.5 months [95% CI, 13.0-not available]; high-dose linifanib, 16.4 months [95% CI, 11.9-21.7]; low-dose linifanib, 12.0 months [95% CI, 10.1-13.0]). ORRs were similar (bevacizumab, 34.7% [95% CI, 21.7-49.6]; low-dose linifanib, 24.0% [95% CI, 13.1-38.2]; high-dose linifanib, 22.4% [95% CI, 11.8-36.6]). Median cycles of 5-fluorouracil were reduced in the linifanib arms, versus the bevacizumab arm. Grade 3/4 adverse event occurrences were more frequent with linifanib. Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, hypothyroidism, and thrombocytopenia were more common with high-dose linifanib than bevacizumab. Combining linifanib with mFOLFOX6 as a second-line treatment for metastatic CRC did not improve PFS, radiographic findings, or duration of response versus bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6."

    publictitle "FDA drug approval summary: bevacizumab plus FOLFOX4 as second-line treatment of colorectal cancer."
    briefsummary "On June 20, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA), administered in combination with FOLFOX4 (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) for the second-line treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. Efficacy and safety were demonstrated in one Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) open-label, multicenter, randomized, three-arm, active-controlled trial enrolling 829 adult patients. Patients had received a fluoropyrimidine- and irinotecan-based regimen as initial therapy for metastatic disease; or they had received prior adjuvant irinotecan-based chemotherapy and had recurred within 6 months of completing therapy. Treatments included bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg, as a 90-minute i.v. infusion on day 1, every 2 weeks, either alone or in combination with FOLFOX4, or FOLFOX4 alone. The bevacizumab monotherapy arm was closed to accrual after an interim efficacy analysis suggested a possibly shorter survival in that arm. Overall survival (OS), the primary study endpoint, was significantly longer for patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with FOLFOX4 than for those receiving FOLFOX4 alone. The objective response rate was significantly higher in the FOLFOX4 plus bevacizumab arm than in the FOLFOX4 alone arm. The duration of response was approximately 6 months for both treatment arms. Patients treated with the bevacizumab combination were also reported, based on investigator assessment, to have significantly longer progression-free survival. There were no new bevacizumab safety signals. The most serious, and sometimes fatal, bevacizumab toxicities are gastrointestinal perforation, wound-healing complications, hemorrhage, arterial thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, nephrotic syndrome, and congestive heart failure."

    publictitle "Addition of bevacizumab to fluorouracil-based first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: pooled analysis of cohorts of older patients from two randomized clinical trials."
    briefsummary "Colorectal cancer (CRC) occurs predominantly in older persons. To provide more statistical power to assess risk/benefit in older patients, we examined the clinical benefit of bevacizumab (BV) plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in first-line metastatic CRC (mCRC) treatment in patients aged > or = 65 years, using data pooled from two placebo-controlled studies. Pooled efficacy data for 439 patients > or = 65 years old randomized to BV plus chemotherapy (n = 218) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n = 221) in study 1 and study 2 were retrospectively analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response. Safety analysis was based on reports of targeted adverse events in treated patients. Median OS with BV plus chemotherapy was 19.3 v 14.3 months with placebo plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.90; P = .006). Patients treated with BV plus chemotherapy had a median PFS of 9.2 v 6.2 months for placebo plus chemotherapy patients (HR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.67; P < .0001). The objective response rate was 34.4% with BV plus chemotherapy versus 29.0% with placebo plus chemotherapy (difference not statistically significant). Rates of BV-associated adverse events in the pooled BV plus chemotherapy group were consistent with those reported in the overall populations for the two studies. Analysis of pooled patient cohorts age >/= 65 years from two similar trials in mCRC indicates that adding bevacizumab to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy improved OS and PFS, similar to the benefits in younger patients. Also, the risks of treatment do not seem to exceed those in younger patients with mCRC."
